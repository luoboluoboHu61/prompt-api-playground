# 🧠 GPT Prompt API Playground

This is a lightweight demo application that allows users to interact with OpenAI's GPT model via a custom prompt interface. The app is built using **Streamlit** for the frontend and **OpenAI API** for backend interaction.

<br/>

## Features

- Submit any prompt and receive GPT-4 responses in real-time
- Optional system prompt customization
- Adjustable temperature (creativity level)
- Clean, intuitive UI with emoji-enhanced inputs

<br/>

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python, OpenAI GPT-4 API
- **Deployment**: Local or Streamlit Cloud
